\textbf{\textit{Abstract} - With the use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), it could become possible for autonomous driving systems to operate passenger cars at the limits of handling, which could help prevent accidents. In order to achieve NMPC, a valid model of the dynamic behaviour of a vehicle is essential. This paper describes how a model of the tire characteristics of a vehicle is designed, using a sensor-equipped scaled RC car. In order to do so, many characteristics of the dynamics of the car are measured. Using those data and the Bicycle Model, the slip angles, slip ratios and tire forces are calculated. Afterwards, the tire characteristics are modeled using the Magic Formula. This method proves to be a useful approach, but due to some minor errors in the test data, only a part of the tire characteristics could be determined.}
