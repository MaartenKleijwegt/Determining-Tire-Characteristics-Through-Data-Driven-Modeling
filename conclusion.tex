\section{Conclusion}
The experiments have provided decent data from which the tire characteristics in longitudinal motion could be derived. The IMU has proven to be a great improvement to the project and even though its test results are noisy, they provide a very good insight in the speed and acceleration of the car. From this data, together with the hall-effect sensor data and the used models, a tire model is designed that sufficiently represents the tire characteristics in the longitudinal motion of the car. 
	Even though there is still much room for improvement, this method for determining tire characteristics has proven to be promising. With adjustments that will be discussed in Section 6, a valid representation of the tire characteristics can be made, which could be even closer to reality than currently calculated.
